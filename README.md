# gridsome-plugin-og-generator
A gridsome plugin to generate dynamic og images for blog posts.

This is an experimental plugin I am working on and it is still in development and not doing what it's supposed to do yet. The idea is to generate an [open-graph](https://ogp.me/) image with a an already 
made markup, each generated image will only the title of the blog post change and other few metas like date, category, tags, etc.
